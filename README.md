# BGE-File
A somewhat nice and easy (binary-level) file reader and writer utility in a single header for C++.
Shamelessly ripped out of a personal game engine project and made public
because it do be useful sometimes in other projects.

Feel free to use, but remember to at least credit me (GAMINGNOOBdev)
as the owner/creator of this file.
